#A beginner's homage to the Starbucks.co.uk website#

This is my recreation of the mobile, and using media queries, the desktop version of Starbuck's UK site.

I have used html and css which i've been learning part-time since 10 May 2022, and worked on this for two weeks.

There are several things i'd like to improve on.

Html:

- There are still a number of IDs in my html and it would be preferable for them to be classes (I ran out of time!)

Desktop version:

- the sidebar section of the desktop site isn't quite right; the real one goes all of the way to the top of the page when a user scrolls, whereas mine currently doesn't.
- the 'Starbucks rewards' and 'Starbucks delivers' sections do not look as they do on the real site, which has the image in the centre and paragraph and header to the right of it.

Mobile version:

- the boxes with shadows seem to cut off slightly on the right hand side
- I have not achieved the effect of the burger menu becoming an X when clicked

Please note I haven't used Starbucks' font SoDo Sans. I have replaced it with Work Sans from Google Fonts.
